# Tauri + React + TypeScript Application

This is a template for a Tauri application with a React frontend and TypeScript. It includes a basic login form and a sidecar process for handling background tasks.

## Purpose

This application serves as a starting point for building cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies. It demonstrates how to integrate Tauri with a React frontend, and how to manage sidecar processes.

## Setup

To get started, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

## Usage

The application will open in a new window. You will see a login form. The form is a placeholder and does not have any authentication logic.
